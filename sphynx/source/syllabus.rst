Welcome to the SimCenter AI Workshop 2021.  Due to COVID-19, this year's offering will be solely online. A drawback of an online offering is the lack of interaction among the participants. The SimCenter team is putting in all effort to recreate some
of the community building benefits through discussion sessions and social time.

The bootcamp is organized as a series of live video conferencing (ZOOM), prerecorded video
lectures, hands-on exercises with online review options, and homework assignments.  The
ideal flow of lessons and activities is provided in the "By Day" listing below.

.. warning::

	Video and linked exercises are due before the online class sections.

	We will spend our live sessions mostly doing hands-on exercises.  Those
	exercises are only effective if you did your self-study assignment before
	we meet.
