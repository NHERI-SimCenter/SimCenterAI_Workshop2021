Welcome to the SimCenter ML/AI Workshop 2021.  Due to COVID-19, this year's offering will be an online format. 
A drawback of an online offering is the lack of interaction among the participants, so we encourage you to be active during the live sessions with questions. The SimCenter intends to create some of the community building - that might otherwise be achieved in-person - through discussion and invites you to join `Office Hours with the Development Team  <https://designsafe-ci.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcpcOmvqjguGNcAkeFzFejGojhVBdd-Hp1Q>`_ to continue these discussions with other members of the Natural Hazards Engineering community.

The bootcamp is organized as a series of pre-recorded video lectures and live online conferencing (Zoom). The lessons and videos are provided in the listing below "by day".  

.. warning::
	Videos must be watched before the online class sessions for the day.
	
	We will spend our live sessions mostly doing hands-on exercises 
	("In-class Exercise" links below), questions, and discussion.  
	Those exercises are only effective if you did your self-study 
	assignment of watching the videos before we meet.
