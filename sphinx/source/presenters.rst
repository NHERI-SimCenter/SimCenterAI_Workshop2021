The workshop has a number of presenters.

* Day 1 - Charles Wang (UC Berkeley)

 **Chaofeng Wang** is a postdoctoral scholar and a member of the development team of NSF NHERI SimCenter, where he develops natural hazard engineering software including BRAILS, s3hark, SWIM, etc. He is specialized in computational mechanics, artificial intelligence, and their applications in civil infrastructure and natural hazard engineering. He will join the University of Florida College of Design, Construction and Planning as an Assistant Professor in August 2021. email c_w(at)berkeley.edu

* Day 2 - Barbaros Cetiner (UCLA)

  **Barbaros Cetiner** is a postdoctoral scholar at UCLA and software developer at NHERI SimCenter. He is one of the lead developers of the AI-based inventory development application BRAILS, which automatically generates the building information required for regional loss assessments due to natural hazards. Dr. Cetiner received his Doctorate in structural mechanics from UCLA, M.S. in structural and earthquake engineering from UCLA, and B.S. in civil engineering from The State University of New York at Buffalo. Dr. Cetiner has long been invested in hazards engineering research. His latest research efforts focus on exploring the new frontiers at the intersection of AI and hazards engineering. email bacetiner(at)ucla.edu

* Day 3 - Yunhui Guo (UC Berkeley)

  **Yunhui Guo** is a postdoctoral scholar working on AI software development with SimCenter domain expert Professor Stella Yu at UC Berkeley. Dr. Guo is developing computer vision and machine learning algorithms that infer large-scale building information from publicly available images and associated records. Dr. Guo received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from UC San Diego. His research interests include efficient machine learning and deep learning with a focus on transfer learning, multi-task learning, few-shot learning, and lifelong learning models. His work experiences include research internships at Qualcomm AI Research, IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, and Intel Corporation. He has also published numerous papers for technical conferences on machine learning. email yunhui(at)berkeley.edu
