Binder
============

Binder is a free service which provides researchers with a platform for sharing Jupyter notebooks.
Much like Google Colab, Binder allows users to quickly and easily run notebooks over a browser on preconfigured servers meaning no installations are required for the user.

Binder does not require users to register for an account of any sort, unlike Colab. It also provides a familiar interface which is nearly identical to a locally hosted Jupyter server. However, Binder does not provide GPU support meaning that certain notebooks may run much slower than on Colab.

Notebooks can be cloned and configured on Binder directly from Github simply by using a uniquely constructed URL.

Google Colab
============

Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, allows you to write and execute Python in your browser. It is free to use and provides you access to GPU's, which are a must have resource for performing ML operations on realistic projects. For this course you can think of Colab as a resource that allows you to run Jupyter notebooks stored on google drive. Here is the `basic Google introduction
