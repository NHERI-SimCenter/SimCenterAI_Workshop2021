.. warning:

   You should only use the TACC resources if your employer forbids you from using Colab. We have not requested a special allocation for this workshop and as such the responses times when utilizing the GPU resources will be much slower than Colab.

DesignSafe-ci is closely integerated within `TACC <https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/>`_. TACC designs and deploys the world's most powerful advanced computing technologies and innovative software solutions to enable researchers to answer complex questions like those you are researching and many more. For this workshop, and thanks to DesignSafe-ci, TACC are making available to you access to one of the fastest supercomputers in the world. To make use of these resources you need to be a `good citizen <https://frontera-portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guide/citizenship/>`_ while utilizing them.

We will be using the `**Frontera** <https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/frontera>`_ system and they provide a comprehinsive set of `usage notes <https://frontera-portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guide/>`_ . The following is a brief overview of it with Linux commands for this workshop.
