.. warning:

   If your employer prohibits you from using Colab you should use the DesignSafe-ci resources. Queue wait times when utilizing the GPU resources at DesignSafe will be much slower than Colab. Plan to start an **HPC Jupyter** job 2 hours before the start of the online exercise if you will be using this DesignSafe.
   
   You must have a `DesignSafe account <https://www.designsafe-ci.org/register/>`_ to access the tools in the `**Workspace** <https://www.designsafe-ci.org/rw/discovery-workspace/>`_. Registration authorization can take 24 hours, so please do this as soon as possible if you are not able to use Colab and do not already have an account.

DesignSafe-ci is closely integrated within `TACC <https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/>`_. TACC designs and deploys the world's most powerful advanced computing technologies and innovative software solutions to enable researchers to answer complex questions like those you are researching. For this workshop, and thanks to DesignSafe-ci, TACC is making available access to one of the fastest supercomputers in the world. To make use of these resources you need to be a `good citizen <https://frontera-portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guide/citizenship/>`_ while utilizing them.

If needed, you will be using the `**Frontera** <https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/frontera>`_ system and they provide a comprehensive set of `usage notes <https://frontera-portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guide/>`_.
